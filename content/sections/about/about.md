I’m a self taught Developer from a time when there were no coding bootcamps or accelerated web degrees. My path to coding was a slow burn that gave me the passion and determination needed to excel in my career. 

In my 10 years of experience working in the industry, I have been blessed to work on some awesome projects and with some amazing people.

I’ve built websites and donation campaigns that have resulted in donation amounts of more than 1Million dollars for national non-profits like Humane Society and American Heart Association.

I worked with [IBM Watson](/watson-edu) to build their first go to market application in the education industry to specifically help teachers manage their classroom using AI.

Led development and management of IBM Quantum’s first publicly branded [marketing site](/quantum-site) that grew to over 1Million+ views annually and ranked #1 organically on Google, for the search term “What is Quantum Computing?”.
